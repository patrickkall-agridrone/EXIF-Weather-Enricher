# EXIF Weather Enricher

This Python script enriches the EXIF metadata of images with weather information based on the GPS coordinates found in the EXIF data. It uses the Azure Maps Weather Service to fetch the current weather conditions and embeds them into the EXIF data of the images.

## Features

- Fetches current weather conditions from the Azure Maps Weather Service.
- Enriches the EXIF metadata with weather data:
  - Temperature (Â°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - UV Index
  - Weather Phrase (e.g., Cloudy, Sunny)
  - Pressure (hPa)
